# ENVI5809-GROUP-6-PROJECT-
Spatio-Temporal Dynamics and Environmental Drivers of Zostera capricorni in the Great Barrier Reef (2010–2018) with Short-Term Forecasts  
## Overview
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks and datasets used for the ENVI5809 project analyzing the **spatio-temporal dynamics** and **environmental drivers** of *Zostera capricorni* (ZC) seagrass in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), with short-term forecasts from 2019–2023.

All analyses use data from **JCU TropWATER seagrass surveys (1984–2018)** and **eReefs environmental model outputs**, integrating biological, physical, and biotic covariates to explore ecological relationships and predictive modeling performance.

## Scientific Questions / Hypotheses

1. **Spatio-temporal dynamics:**  
   How does monthly occupancy of *Zostera capricorni* vary across eight GBR sites and seasons (2010–2018)?

2. **Environmental drivers:**  
   Which eReefs variables (temperature, salinity, sea-level anomaly η, currents, wind), including 1-month lags, are significantly associated with ZC occupancy?

3. **Biotic interactions:**  
   How is *Halophila ovalis* (HO) occupancy associated with *Zostera capricorni* presence, and does HO act as a positive or negative biotic covariate?

4. **Forecasting:**
    Can models trained on 2010–2018 data forecast ZC occupancy for 2019–2023 and outperform persistence and seasonal-naïve baselines?
